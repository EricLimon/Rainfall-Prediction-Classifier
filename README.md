# Weather Data Analysis and Prediction Project

This project analyzes and predicts weather data from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, covering daily observations from 2008 to 2017. It includes variables like temperature, rainfall, wind, and humidity.

## Objectives

* **Feature Engineering:** Prepare data for analysis and modeling.
* **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values and inconsistencies.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize and understand data patterns.
* **Model Building:** Develop machine learning models for weather prediction.
* **Model Evaluation:** Assess model performance using relevant metrics.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize model performance.

## Dataset

* Source: Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM)
* Timeframe: 2008-2017
* Variables: Temperature, rainfall, wind, humidity, etc.

## Getting Started

1.  **Download the dataset:** From the Australian Bureau of Meteorology website or from the next url: `git clone' https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package?resource=download&select=weatherAUS.csv
2.  **Open the Jupyter Notebook:** Use Alligator (or your preferred environment) to open and execute the `.ipynb` file.

## Instructions

* The analysis and modeling are contained in the Jupyter Notebook.
* Follow the instructions within the notebook to run the code and reproduce the results.

## Tools and Technologies

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Machine Learning Libraries (e.g., scikit-learn)
* Data Visualization Libraries (e.g., matplotlib, seaborn)
